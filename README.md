The company has not been incorporated yet. 
* Who are the founders of the company?
The information about the founders of PayBright is not available online. However, Wayne Pommen has been the President and CEO of the organization for the past five years. 
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
As Ecommerce has grown in the past decade, there are companies who have adapted to the growing needs of the consumer. The founders noticed that there was an opportunity to make payments easier for the consumers and thus, in 2009 Paybright was founded to facilitate those needs. Initially their customer base who only the healthcare sector but they have slowly grown to helping all types of ECommerce brands.

PayBright is funded privately by differently companies. They have been funded by Canadian Business Growth Fund. They have recieved funding from iA Financial Group and more recently, Goeasy Ltd. These two transactions have totalled $60 million. 
There has not been an IPO yet and thus, not all transactions and investments may be public. 

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Users are able to buy products and pay in increments. These are small loans which enables customers to shop from online retailers. This helps the customers purchase products and not have to make the full payment at the same time. On the other hand, it helps businesses increase sales as there are more people that can afford their products. 
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The intended customer for Paybright are the customers who are shopping online. 
According to statistica, online retail sales of physical goods amounted to 343.15 billion USD. Due to covid19, online sales will be much higher this year. PayBright can take advantage of this growing market space by partnering with more online retailers. 
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) 
In 2009, ECommerce companies were just starting to take off. Being the first to market in Canada has helped PayBright develop relationships with companies like EBay, The Source and Shopify. Having built this relationships with such important players in the market, along with having a substantial about of funding has led them to be able to lend at a large scale and grow quickly. Other startups cannot build relations this quickly and will be unable to lend without a large amount of investment. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
PayBright has given options to merchants to include a Paybright option at the checkout. This option allows thousands of merchants to make incremental payments for the products that they buy. Paybright has a securitization facility that helps keeps customer's information secure. This facility is funded by a top 5 bank in Canada. On stackshare, it shows that the organization uses sites like wordpress and Google Analytics as a business tool. It helps them connect to the right type of customers. For Applications, they use JQuery, PHP, NGINX, Ubuntu, and Slick. 


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
They will be in the Lending domain. 
Paybright is lending money to customers by allowing them to purchase products online and they can make monthly payments. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Lending has been around for a long period of time. However, the major innovation is that consumers have an alternative from credit cards now. Consumers can chose to purchase products and rather than paying their credit card companies, they can use new fintech lendning companies to purchase their products. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Internationally, there are many competitors that are competing with PayBright. In Australia, AfterPay and in Sweden, Klarna are prominent competitors. Since Ecommerce is a worldwide platform, lending companies may compete internationally. 
The biggest competitor in Canada is Flexiti Financial. Flexiti have a slightly different approach in this space. Flexiti have a their own credit card. They are going after established credit card companies but they are emerging in lending space as well. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
The organization is currently partnering with over 4,000 retailers to provide an on the spot credit approval. This is a fast automated process that allows quick loans for a short period of time. PayBright has had a significant impact in the industry as it has helped big Tech Companies like Lenovo and IBM and smaller dropshippers on Shopify to increase their sales. Working with such a diverse group of retailers means PayBright has a strong hold in the industry.


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
The most important metric is the interest rate. Paybright offers short term loans which means consumers may be willing to pay a higher interest rate. Usually customers make biweekly or monthly payments for less than 6 months. The interest rates can be around 7% which the customers are willing to pay. Even though the the company does not release official numbers, according to their website, Paybright has served hundreds of thousands of customers. 
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? Paybright has been able to be a prominent player in the lending space online. The company is one of the bigger players in the market. However, Afterpay, an Australian lender, has been able to gain a substantial amount of market share. Afterpay, as of 19th September, 2020, is trading at AUD $75.80. The company reported Revenue of 251.6 million Australian Dollar. While the numbers of PayBright are not public, it can be said that their profits may be lesser than AfterPay as they have less market share. Also, AfterPay, has developed subsidairies which are an additional source of revenue. On the other hand, Paybright has not been able to diversify their income as effectively. 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
If I were to advise PayBright, I would highly recommend the company to issue credit cards like their competitors. There are companies such as Koho and Flexiti who are also in the lending space in Canada. I believe PayBright may be able to benefit from competing in this space as they have already proven to be a major player in the lending space online.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
The organization already has tools in place to check credit and providing lending services. There is a huge space in the market for credit cards. This space is no longer exclusively for bigger credit card companies like Mastercard and Visa as there are smaller startups which are starting to compete. I believe Paybright should tap into this market. 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Paybright will not be able to provide instant approvals/rejections for every customer that applies for their credit cards. In many circumstances the customers will need to wait to get approvals. Looking at stackshare for companies like Mastercard, I can tell that the company will require the use of more technology. They may need to use Python or Java to program. They will also need a cloud computing platform like Amazon Web Services to store information of a increasing amount of customers. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Since the credit card space is a much bigger market than just small online lending, Paybright will require the technology mentioned above. I believe they may need Amazon Web Service or a similar cloud computing platform like Microsoft Azure to manage their increasing amount of customer base. Also, they will need to develop systems and programs to filter out customers. Those programs can be developed through programming using Python or a similar language.
